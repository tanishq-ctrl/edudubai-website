## Contextual, Clean Backgrounds - Relevant but Not Busy

## 1. Become a Trainer Page

**Prompt:**
```
A professional training room or modern classroom environment, photographed from the back looking toward the front. Empty chairs and desks visible but blurred in the foreground. A presentation screen or whiteboard in soft focus at the front. Navy blue and gold color tones. Soft, diffused professional lighting. The scene is empty - no people. Shot with shallow depth of field so the background is beautifully blurred, creating a clean canvas for text overlay. Photorealistic, premium quality, corporate training aesthetic. The image should clearly suggest "training" and "education" but remain minimal and elegant.
```

**Alternative:**
```

## 2. Course Catalogue Page

**Prompt:**

A clean desk or table surface in the foreground, slightly out of focus. Navy blue and gold accents in the color grading. Warm, inviting lighting. No people visible. The books and shelves should be recognizable but heavily blurred, creating a sophisticated backdrop that says "learning" without being distracting. Photorealistic, premium quality, academic excellence aesthetic.

## 3. Corporate Training Page

**Prompt:**
```
A high-end corporate boardroom or executive meeting space, photographed with shallow depth of field. Blurred modern office chairs around a sleek conference table. Large windows with soft, out-of-focus city skyline in the background. Navy blue and gold corporate color palette. Professional, sophisticated lighting. The room is empty - no people. Everything is elegantly blurred except for perhaps a clean table surface in the foreground. The image should clearly convey "corporate" and "professional" while remaining clean and minimal. Photorealistic, premium quality, executive aesthetic.

## 4. About Page

**Prompt:**
```
A modern, professional office space or headquarters lobby, photographed with shallow depth of field. Blurred architectural elements suggesting stability and trust - perhaps columns, glass walls, or modern design features. Subtle global elements like a soft-focus world map on the wall or international flags barely visible in the background. Navy blue and gold color scheme. Warm, welcoming lighting. No people visible. The space should feel established, trustworthy, and international, but everything is beautifully blurred to create a clean backdrop. Photorealistic, premium quality, corporate headquarters aesthetic.

## Design Guidelines for All Images

### Key Photography Technique:
**Shallow Depth of Field (Bokeh Effect)**
- This is the secret to contextual but clean backgrounds
- The scene is recognizable but heavily blurred
- Creates a professional, premium look
- Doesn't compete with text overlay

### Color Palette:
- **Primary:** Navy Blue (#1e3a5f)
- **Accent:** Gold (#d4af37)
- **Supporting:** Natural tones, warm lighting

### Technical Specifications:
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 or wider for hero sections
- **Resolution:** Minimum 1920x1080px (preferably 2560x1440px)
- **Depth of Field:** Shallow (f/1.8 to f/2.8 equivalent)
- **Focus:** Background elements heavily blurred
- **File Format:** WebP for web optimization (with JPG fallback)
- **Style:** Photorealistic, professional photography

### What Makes These Work:
✅ **Contextual** - Each background relates to its page purpose
✅ **Clean** - Heavy blur keeps them from being distracting
✅ **Professional** - Premium photography aesthetic
✅ **No People** - Keeps focus on the message
✅ **Text-Friendly** - Blurred backgrounds work perfectly with text overlays

### Photography Keywords to Emphasize:
- "Shallow depth of field"
- "Soft focus"
- "Blurred background"
- "Bokeh effect"
- "Empty space"
- "No people"

## Example Reference Style

Think of these like professional corporate photography:
- **Apple Store** product photography (blurred environment)
- **LinkedIn** header images (professional but soft)
- **Corporate annual reports** (elegant, contextual, minimal)

The key is: **The viewer knows what the space is, but it's blurred enough to be elegant and not distracting.**

## Usage Instructions

1. **Generate Images:** Use these prompts in Whisk
2. **Emphasize:** Stress "shallow depth of field" and "blurred background"
3. **Check:** Ensure the context is clear but not busy
4. **Download:** Save in high resolution
5. **Optimize:** Convert to WebP format
6. **Test:** Verify text readability over the background

**Pro Tip:** If the background is still too busy, you can add a subtle dark overlay (rgba(30, 58, 95, 0.3)) in CSS to ensure perfect text readability while maintaining the contextual atmosphere.
