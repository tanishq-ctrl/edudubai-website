## Image Placeholders

Until actual images are added, the components will gracefully handle missing images by:
- Showing a gradient background fallback (brand navy gradient)
- Not breaking the layout or functionality
- Maintaining all features (carousel autoplay, navigation, etc.)

## Tips

- Use high-quality, professional images that represent the page content
- Ensure images work well with dark overlay gradients for text readability
- Consider using stock photos from sites like Unsplash, Pexels, or custom photography
- Maintain consistent styling and color tone across all hero images
- Test images with the dark overlay to ensure text remains readable
